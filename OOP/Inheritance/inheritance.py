# Inheritance is a fundamental concept in object-oriented programming that allows a class (the child or derived class) to inherit

# Student
    #name, surname, no
    #study()
    #eat()

# Teacher
    #name, surname, department
    #teach()
    #eat()

#Some attributes or some methods are common in different classes. Because of that we can create a class, which has the common attributes or methods

#Person
    #name,surname, address
    #eat()

#Person is now base/parent class and the other class, which inherits from parent class are child classes.
# Thank inheritance we dont need create common object attributes or methods in child classes.
#We have them in parent class. Thats very practical and spare time and code line.
