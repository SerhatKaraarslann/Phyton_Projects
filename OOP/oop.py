#Object Oriented Programming

#class
#instance (object)


#<class 'list'> Hier our lst is an instance(object) from list class
#when i create an object from a class, i actually creaze a copy from this class with the properties, methodes. atributes from this before defined class
lst = [1,2,3]
result = type(lst)
print(result)   

#hier ist the type again <class 'list'>
lst2 = [1,2,3,4,5,6]
result = type(lst2) 
print(result)  

# we can use the methods with of this class with the "." 
#lst2. => then i see the defined methods and can use these mehtods of this class 

#I can create my class too
